/*echo "What is abstract Classes";

	You can create abstract classes in php using abstract keyword.
	Abstract classes are those classes which can not be directly initialized.
	Or in other word we can say that you can not create object of abstract classes.
	Abstract classes always created for inheritance purpose.
	You can only inherit abstract class in your child class.
	
	Usually abstract class are also known as base class. 
	We call it base class because abstract class are not the class which is available directly for creating object.
	It can only act as parent class of any normal class. You can use abstract class in class hierarchy. 
	Mean one abstract class can inherit another abstract class also.
	
echo "What is Interface ?"; 
	You can create interface in php using keyword interface.
	Interface in oop enforce definition of some set of method in the class.
	By implementing interface you are forcing any class to must declaring some specific set of methods in oop.
	You can implement your interface in your class using implements keyword.
	You can only define method in interface with public accessibility. 
	If you will use other than public visibility in interface then it will throw error. 
	Also while defining method in your interface do not use abstract keyword in your methods.
	You can also extend interface like class. You can extend interface in php using extends keyword.
	You can not implement 2 interfaces if both share function with same name. It will throw error.

	Differences between abstract class and interface in PHP

		Following are some main difference between abstract classes and interface in php

		=>In abstract classes this is not necessary that every method should be abstract. But in interface every method is abstract.
		=>Multiple and multilevel both type of inheritance is possible in interface. But single and multilevel inheritance is possible in abstract classes.
		=>Method of php interface must be public only. Method in abstract class in php could be public or protected both.
		***=>In abstract class you can define as well as declare methods. But in interface you can only defined your methods & we can't define our method.
